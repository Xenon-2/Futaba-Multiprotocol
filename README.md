# Futaba-Multiprotocol
Serial Multiprotocol interface for Futaba or every transmitter with PPM interface ( via trainer port ).

Goal: Give to all futaba radios and more in general to all PPM capable radios the possibility to use the multiprotocol module.

Adavantages: 

1: Use your own trusted transmitter.

2: Use transmitter that has proprietary firmware, stable and solid( e.g. Futaba, Spektrum, Jr ... )

3: Avoid "Loss of conformity" of your trasmitter installing firmwares like OpenTx or EdgeTx, not officially present on the manufacturer website.

4: Save money.
